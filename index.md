I am a Ph.D. student in the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at Peking University (PKU), advised by [Prof. Yitao Liang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yliang/). 
Before joining PKU, I received my MSc and BA degrees in Control Science and Technology from Beijing Institute of Technology.
I work on building open-ended embodied agents with multi-task skills, including visual localization, task planning, and decision-making.  
In particular, I am interested in building and leveraging large pre-trained *Foundation Models* to improve the generalization of agent capabilities.
